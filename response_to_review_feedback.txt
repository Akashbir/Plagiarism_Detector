Team 3: 93/100

Below are some comments about your response to the code review and peer review:

- directory structure is very clean now, no files hanging around randomly
- documentation added to the ast classes
- did not address comments about lack of documentation in the tests and lack of readability of the ASTtests because of the huge strings 
- comment about removing track directory is no longer relevant, since this directory has a purpose now
- overall, good response to feedback
