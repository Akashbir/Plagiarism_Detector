TA Session 9/26
- Made a .gitignore file
- Tried to cover IntelliJ, Eclipse and Java files
- They said that it's okay that it came from the internet
- Need to make sure we don't push IDE / local environment files

- Need to use Java version 8 or greater (lower versions don't support lambdas)
- And everyone needs to be on the same version

- Do frequent, small commits to make it easier to track issues
- Don't email code and have teammates commit for you

- Create a bunch of issues on github with items to implement
- ex. frontend login, backend login, setup database, pick an api for something, etc
- Use Labels for ToDo, In Progress, etc

- (Use the same name as the issue you are working on)
- Branches should live for a couple days, tickets/issues should be small
- git branch <new-branch>  
- git checkout <branch-name>
- delete a branch on your machine locally: git branch -d <finished-issue>  (I think)

- Create branches for new features
- Commit changes to branch but always pull from master
- You want to be pulling master updates into your branch frequently, and definitely
- right before doing the pull request -> you need other people's updates!
- (so you don't lose your work or delete someone else's)
- Create pull request: assign people to review (only one of the people chosen needs to approve)
- After approved, the merge with master button is available
- Close the branch once you're finished

- Insights tab will show merges across branches
- push and pull from YOUR branch
- the graph should look as simple as possible

- Jenkins
- Do not edit the Jenkinsfile!

- Maven
- New Project
- Set correct SDK
- Maven project from left-hand list
- Check the box for "Create from archetype"
- Choose the one that ends in -quickstart, then hit next
- GroupId: org.neu
- ArtifactId: PlagiarismDetector
- Created PlagiarismDetector project inside Project_src folder

- Sonarlint
- Add sonarlint project to IntelliJ
- File > Settings > Plugins > search for sonarlint, install
- Restart IntelliJ, now there is a SonarLint in the bottom left corner next to TODO
