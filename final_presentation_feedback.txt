Group 3 -- 91/100

Overall, it was a good presentation, and the team did good job while adopting a very general approach. Below are some specific comments/feedback:

Pros: 
- the work should carry over well to many other languages given the way the implementation is structured
- the team implemented 4 different algorithms, and covered 3 programming languages which is very good
- the presentation covered various aspects of the project (user-interface, algorithms used, lessons learned, room for improvement)
- the demo was good, showing good error handling beyond the obvious side-by-side view with highlighting of plagiarized code fragments

Cons:
- using a string-based algorithm will limit the effectiveness of the plagiarism detector 
- it seemed like there were some issues with the group dynamics, with different levels of involvement by the team members (though not to an extent that this seemed to be a problem)
- work on the visitor-based algorithm was incomplete at the time of the presentation
