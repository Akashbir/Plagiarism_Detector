Group 3 ---- 89
- UI: could have shown highlighting of similar code fragments
- UI: good to show markup for error message scenario
- depth of comparison seems like a useful feature when processing time becomes an issue
- class diagram: not clear hwy you use both interfaces and abstract classes for system components
- we strongly recommend using an existing solution for building ASTs, like ANTLR
- removing comments: this means you cannot check for similarities in comments
- normalizing over simple lexical modifications will be interesting if they can get it working
- division of work not clear
